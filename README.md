# 🌱 SDG Buddy

**Your personal, gamified tracker for contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.**

---

## 🌍 Project Overview
**SDG Buddy** is a mobile and web application designed to translate the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into tangible, everyday actions.  

It serves as a personal tracker, enabling individuals to log their sustainable behaviors and quantify their contribution toward achieving the **17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).**

Unlike apps that focus narrowly on environmental metrics, SDG Buddy takes a **holistic approach**, encompassing the full, interconnected spectrum of the SDGs — including social and economic goals such as:

- **Quality Education (SDG 4)**
- **Gender Equality (SDG 5)**
- **Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10)**

The ultimate goal is to **empower a global community** of users to understand, track, and amplify their personal impact on a sustainable future.
