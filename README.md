🌱 SDG BuddyYour personal, gamified tracker for contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.🌍 Project Overview"SDG Buddy" is a mobile and web application designed to translate the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into tangible, everyday actions. It serves as a personal tracker, enabling individuals to log their sustainable behaviors and quantify their contribution toward achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Unlike apps that focus narrowly on environmental metrics, "SDG Buddy" takes a holistic approach, encompassing the full, interconnected spectrum of the SDGs, including social and economic goals such as Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10).The ultimate goal is to empower a global community of users to understand, track, and amplify their personal impact on a sustainable future.✨ Key FeaturesHolistic Action Logging: Log daily activities across all 17 SDGs, from recycling and conserving water to volunteering and promoting equality.Gamified Motivation: Stay engaged with a system of points, streaks, badges, and leaderboards to make habit-building fun and rewarding.Impact Visualization: A personal dashboard translates your actions into real-world, understandable metrics (e.g., "kg of CO2 avoided," "liters of water saved").Community & Collaboration: Form teams, participate in challenges, and see the collective impact of the entire "SDG Buddy" community.Educational Insights: Learn about the specific SDG targets your actions contribute to and discover new ways to make a difference.Sleek & Modern UI: A beautiful, tech-forward interface designed to inspire and delight users.🚀 Tech StackThis project is built with a modern, scalable, and type-safe technology stack:Framework: Next.js (App Router)Library: ReactLanguage: TypeScriptStyling: Tailwind CSS📸 Screenshots(Placeholder: Add screenshots of your application here.
